# Temu Captcha Solver API
This project is the [SadCaptcha Temu Captcha Solver](https://www.sadcaptcha.com/temu-captcha-solver?ref=temughclientrepo) API client.
The purpose is to make integrating SadCaptcha into your Selenium, Playwright, or Async Playwright app as simple as one line of code.
Instructions for integrating with Selenium, Playwright, and Async Playwright are described below in their respective sections.

The end goal of this tool is to solve every single Temu captcha. 
Currently we are able to solve the arced slide, puzzle slide, shapes, items, three-by-three, two image, and swap two challenges:

- **Arced Slide** challenge is the one where there is a puzzle piece that travels in an unpredictable trajectory, and there are two possible locations where the solution may be.
- **Puzzle slide** is unique in that the pieces relocate after you drag the slider.
- **Shapes (English only)** challenge shows a picture of various objects and has an associated text challenge.
- **Items (English only)** challenge shows a picture of various objects and has an associated text challenge.
- **Three-by-three** challenge shows a 3x3 grid of images, and asks you to select images according to a text challenge.
- **Swap Two** has two tiles in the wrong order, and asks you to swap two to fix the image.
- **Cats and Cars (English only)** is an adorable challenge but it will wreck your bot.
- **Two image (English only)** is a notorious challenge which presents a text challenge and two side-by-side images.
    
## Requirements
- Python >= 3.10
- **If using Selenium** - Selenium properly installed and in `PATH`
- **If using Playwright** - Playwright must be properly installed with `playwright install`
- **Stealth plugin** - You must use the appropriate `stealth` plugin for whichever browser automation framework you are using.
    - For Selenium, you can use [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver)
    - For Playwright, you can use [playwright-stealth](https://pypi.org/project/playwright-stealth/)

## Installation
This project can be installed with `pip`. Just run the following command:
```
pip install temu-captcha-solver
```

## Selenium Client 
Import the function `make_undetected_chromedriver_solver`
This function will create an undetected chromedriver instance patched with the temu Captcha Solver chrome extension.
The extension will automatically detect and solve the captcha in the background, and there is nothing further you need to do.

```py
from temu_captcha_solver import make_undetected_chromedriver_solver
from selenium_stealth import stealth
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
driver = make_undetected_chromedriver_solver(api_key) # Returns uc.Chrome instance
stealth(driver) # Add stealth if needed
# ... [The rest of your code that accesses temu goes here]

# Now temu captchas will be automatically solved!
```
You may also pass `ChromeOptions` to `make_undetected_chromedriver_solver()`, as well as keyword arguments for `uc.Chrome()`.

## Playwright Client
Import the function `make_playwright_solver_context`
This function will create a playwright BrowserContext instance patched with the temu Captcha Solver chrome extension.
The extension will automatically detect and solve the captcha in the background, and there is nothing further you need to do.

```py
from temu_captcha_solver import make_playwright_solver_context
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
with sync_playwright() as p:
    context = make_playwright_solver_context(p, api_key) # Returns playwright BrowserContext instance
    # ... [The rest of your code that accesses temu goes here]

# Now temu captchas will be automatically solved!
```
You may also pass keyword args to this function, which will be passed directly to playwright's call to `playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context()`.
By default, the user data directory is a tempory directory that is deleted at the end of runtime.

## Async Playwright Client
Import the function `make_async_playwright_solver_context`
This function will create an async playwright BrowserContext instance patched with the temu Captcha Solver chrome extension.
The extension will automatically detect and solve the captcha in the background, and there is nothing further you need to do.

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from temu_captcha_solver import make_async_playwright_solver_context

async def main():
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        context = await make_async_playwright_solver_context(p, api_key) # Returns playwright BrowserContext instance
        # ... [The rest of your code that accesses temu goes here]

asyncio.run(main())

# Now temu captchas will be automatically solved!
```
You may also pass keyword args to this function, which will be passed directly to playwright's call to `playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context()`.
By default, the user data directory is a tempory directory that is deleted at the end of runtime.
